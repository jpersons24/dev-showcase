This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Objective

This project is meant to serve as a personal website. Part portfolio, part blog and any other fun features that I develop to showcase
my capabilities in building quality UI's with backend interaction.

The default template and configurations provided by `create-next-app` have been altered slightly for simplicity.

Typescript will be used rather than Javascript.

## File Structure Conventions

File structure will follow conventions provided by [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure)
